In this section we propose a list containing the materials needed for the project. We have appended the approximate costs of each item on the list -- based on the research we have been doing online.
\subsection{Robotics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Robotic arm metal frame with six degrees of freedom. (approx. 1000 SKr)
        \item MG996R Servo x 4 for movement off the robotic arm. (approx. 80 SKr/each)
        \item MG90S Servo x 2 for movement off the robotic arm. (approx. 80 SKr/each)
        \item Arduino Uno R3 to generate pwm signals to the servos. (approx. 200 SKr)
        \item 5V DC power supply for servos. (approx. 100 SKr)
        \item 12V DC power supply for arduino. (approx. 100 SKr)
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Ball detection}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item High speed cameras (basler ACA800-200GC) x 2. (approx. 1000 SKr/each)
        \item PoE gigabit switch. (approx. 1000 SKr)
        \item Gigabit ethernet cable x 3. (approx. 100 SKr/each)
    \end{itemize}
